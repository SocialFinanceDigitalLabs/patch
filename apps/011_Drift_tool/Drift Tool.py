st.markdown("This dashboard takes historical data about children's Referral, Child Protection plan and CLA status dates and uses it to visualise drift. \
         Drift, in this case means how long it takes to provide children the level of care they need. The key assumption in these visualisations is that \
         in general, if a child moves from one level of Children's Service provision to another, it is likely that they needed that higher level of provision. \
         For instance, if a child recieves a Referral and becomes a CLA, it is likely that the level of provision they needed was a CLA status. \
         By visualising how long it takes to move up stages of provision, we can see how long it takes to meet children's needs. \
         \n \
         \n This set of visualisations needs three CSVs to work, each with two columns, one of Child IDs, and  one of provision start date. \
        The upload takes one CSV of this data for Referrals, one for CP plan, and one for CLA status.")
