    " To use this analysis first upload the relevant data using the widget in the sidebar. This analysis needs three CSVs of data, each with \
            Child/Person IDs and dates of Children's services provision. One CSV for Referrals, one for Child \
            Protection plans, and one for CLA dates. These need to be in the form that appears below: two columns, the first with IDs, the second with dates. \
            Column names do not matter. We recommend using around 20 years worth of data, or as much as is avaliable in order to get an accurate representaiton \
            of drift."

    "The names of each CSV DO matter, however. The Referrals filename must include the word referrals, the Child Protection plans filename must include \
            either CP or Child Protection, and the CLA filename must include either CLA, LAC, or Looked After. Further, filenames for different files cannot \
            include the identifying text for other filenames, or this will confuse the file upload."

    "Once the upload is completed, plots will appear in the main pane, with explanantions for each. Three sliders will also be generated in the sidebar. \
            The first sliders change two things: the first changes how many years worth of uploaded data is used to make drift calculations, the second \
            changes how many years worth of data is displayed in the plots. As is explained on the main page of the app, this view slider defaults to \
            showing the last five years worth of data, as earlier years are more likely to skew lower. The third slider only controls the histogram of \
            wait times and can be used to control which years data is displayed, This alsoi defaults to the last five years. All sliders are double ended \
            and, as such, can be used to select data from any period, although users will have to do some sense checking to determine if their slider choices \
            make sense, as weird things can happen if the time ranges chosen are dramatically different between sliders!"

    "The drift visualisations demonstrate how long it takes children to go between different stages of Children's Services provision. For instance, \
         how long children wait between a referral and a CIN or CP plan, how long children wait between CP plans and a CLA status, \
         and also larger periods such as how long children wait between initial referral and a CLA status. These statistics are presented in two ways, the first is histograms \
        demonstrating spread of wait times between different stages of Children's Services provision. This first visualisation is a useful way of \
        demonstrating what proportions of children are waiting what lengths of times for different levels of provision. The second, and most important visualisation, \
        presents bar and box plots demonstrating the wait times between different provisions starting in different years. This second set of visualisations \
        allows users to see how long children waited tro recieve different types of provision in any year, over a range of years. This can be used to help determine \
        if wait times are improving or not, and see trends in wait times over time"

    "1) The data for the model builds over time, for the earliest years in the data set, there is not much data, as such, the further back you look in the \
            visualisationsthe less appropriate those years are as indications of drift. As such, in the plots which display wait time by end year, only the most \
            recent five years are displayed by default, but the earlier years are still included to demonstrate where the data for the model is drawn from and \
            can be seen by changing sliders or interacting with the plot susing the toolbar on mouse-over. \
            \n \n 2) The model calculates the time between referral and CP plan and referral and CLA  plan by assuming that the last referral before any CP plan \
            or CLA status is the one that lead to that plan or status, this means that for a small number of children who have a referral then CP plan and then CLA \
            status without another referral, the one referral will count as the most recent referral for both the CP plan and the CLA status. This is not necessarily \
            wrong for all cases, as the assumption can be made in some cases that if a child had a referral and was moved from CP plan to CLA status, they ought to \
            have had a CLA status initially, instead of a CP plan. As the number of times this happens is small, relative to the rest of the data, and it happens \
            every year, it it relatively balanced out across the model. \
            \n \n 3) A small number of data points are dropped in an effort to remove data points that the model would calculate incorrectly leading to large \
            false outliers - some children have a referral very shortly after a CP plan or CLA status is started which is due to some quirks in the way that childrens \
            services case management systems work, if those children then move from CLA status to CP plan  years later, the calculations would count that as having \
            waited years from that referral to the CP plan. To avoid this, children who have a referral within two weeks of a CP plan or CLA status are dropped from \
            the model to avoid these large outliers."

    "The model works by matching IDs across the different data tables and using that to find dates for levels of Childrens Services provision where \
         the lower level preceeded the higher level (so rows where a Referral was after a CLA, for instance, are removed). The data is also sorted and organised \
         so that only rows where the most recent escalation of CS provision is counted as the one that lead to a step up (so if a child has two referrals before \
         a CP plan, the most recent referral is considered to be the one that gave rise to the CP plan). This means that we are left only with rows where one \
         event has lead to an escalation, and the preceeding event closest in time to the later event is considered to be the causal event. This means that if a child has \
         two referrals and two CP plans, we will only be left with rows where the earlier referral is linked to the earlier CP plan, and the later referral is linked \
         to the later CP plan."
