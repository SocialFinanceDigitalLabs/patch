    <p>
      Welcome to PATCh, the Python Analysis Toolkit for Childrens services. PATCh is a set of free and open-source data apps made by local authority analysts. 
      The platform is managed by <a href="https://www.datatoinsight.org/">Data to Insight</a>, and it was developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.socialfinance.org.uk/#">Social Finance</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.wigan.gov.uk/index.aspx">Wigan Council</a>, and volunteers from multiple local authorities.
    </p>
    <p>

      PATCh runs entirely in your web browser, which means that no data about children leaves your network when you use it, and you don’t need to install extra software to use it. 
      We review code submissions from local authority analysts prior to sharing them via PATCh, and we share all code via the D2I code library for anyone to inspect. 
      To view our full warranty/disclaimer, which you agree to by continuing to use the tool, please click

        >here</a
      >.
    <p>
      PATCh is designed to help you learn to code and share your work, as well as to benefit from others doing the same. 
      You’ll find buttons to view code and contribute code at the top of each app. We also offer support to LA analysts seeking to learn Python.
